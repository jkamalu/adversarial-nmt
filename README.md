# Unidirectional-NMT

In this library we train experiments using neural machine translation that leverage the adversarial regularizing term proposed by Lample et al. 2017. Our experiments are run in a fully supervised training setting.

### Set-up the environment

To set up the environment create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies stored in requirements.tx
